# Creating an Account

A Palaten-Studios account is required for most of our services.
It can be created using the [Sign up](https://palaten.de/register) page.

Now you'll need to select a username, enter your email address and
choose a strong password.

Then you need to navigate into your Mail provider and look for emails
from us (Check the Spam folder too).

After clicking on `Verify`, your account will be verified and you
will be automatically logged in.

It's that easy.
